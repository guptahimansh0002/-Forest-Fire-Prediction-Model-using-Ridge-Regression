# Test Forest Fire

This project analyzes and predicts the likelihood of forest fires based on various environmental factors.  
It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training steps.  

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in forest fire data
- Feature engineering for better model accuracy
- Machine learning model training for fire prediction
- Organized Jupyter notebooks for reproducibility

## Installation
